The Blood Donation Management System is a web-based application designed
to connect users who need blood with hospitals and blood banks. The main aim
is to streamline the process of blood donation requests and management,
making it easier for both donors and hospitals to communicate their needs and
available resources.
Key Features:
1. User Registration and Profile Management:
Users can create an account by providing essential information such as
name, email, phone number, blood group, and city.
They have the option to update their profiles, including changing their
password and contact information.
2. Blood Information Management:
Users can add their blood group to the system. The application checks
for duplicate entries to maintain data integrity.
Users can also view available blood types in hospitals and request
blood when needed.
3. Blood Request Management:
Users can submit blood requests to hospitals if they need blood.
The system allows users to check the status of their requests (pending,
approved, or rejected).
4. Donation Requests from Hospitals:
Hospitals can request blood donations from registered users, ensuring
that they can meet their patients' needs.
Users have the option to accept or reject these donation requests,
which also updates the hospital's records accordingly.

5. Hospital Registration and Management:
Hospitals can register on the platform, managing their profile and
available blood types.
They can view blood requests from users, allowing them to approve or
reject these requests based on their inventory.
6. Admin Dashboard (Optional Feature):
An admin panel can be implemented to manage users, hospitals, and
blood records, ensuring the platform runs smoothly and effectively.
Technology Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with Bootstrap for responsive design).
Backend: PHP for server-side scripting.
Database: MySQL for data storage, ensuring data integrity and security.
Database Design:
The database consists of several key tables:
Users Table: Stores user information, including name, email, phone
number, blood group, and city.
Hospitals Table: Contains details about hospitals, including name, email,
password, phone number, and city.
Blood Requests Table: Records requests made by users for blood,
including status and related user and hospital IDs.
Blood Information Table: Holds records of available blood types and their
corresponding hospitals.
Challenges Faced:
Data Integrity: Ensuring that no duplicate blood group entries occur and
maintaining consistency in the data across different tables.
User Authentication: Implementing secure login and registration processes
to protect sensitive user information.
Real-Time Updates: Managing real-time notifications for blood requests
and donation requests effectively without overwhelming users with too
many notifications.
Future Improvements:

trends and needs based on historical data.
Conclusion:
This project is essential for facilitating blood donation and managing blood
resources effectively, ultimately aiming to save lives by ensuring that those in
need have timely access to blood. By connecting users with hospitals, the
system enhances community engagement in blood donation efforts, making it a
crucial resource in healthcare.
